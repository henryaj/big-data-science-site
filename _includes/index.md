### About the organisers

The **[Biogerontology Research Foundation (BGRF)](http://www.bg-rf.org.uk/)** seeks to fill a gap within the research community, whereby the current scientific understanding of the ageing process is not yet being sufficiently exploited to produce effective medical interventions. The BGRF will fund research which, building on the body of knowledge about how ageing happens, will develop biotechnological interventions to remediate the molecular and cellular deficits which accumulate with age and which underlie the ill-health of old age.

**[Aging Analytics](http://aginganalytics.com)** performs innovative research in biotechnology and regenerative medicine, keeping abreast of the newest processes and technologies for extending life. Our company aims to use its knowledge of anti-aging technologies and current research paradigms to create invaluable databases and provide a supporting framework for financial decision making. Thus, we use our analytical instruments to qualify capital allocation decisions.  We also offer strategic consulting in the field of regenerative medicine.
